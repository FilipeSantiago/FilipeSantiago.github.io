But, happily,  I'm not a completely lost cause, so there are some of my hobbies. <br /> <br /> Reading a book is probably my most constant hobby. Because it's good before sleep, reading a good story at our own pace, leaving the day-by-day stress aside, and having a good night of sleep. Not so efficient when you lose track of time though. <br /> <br /> I always loved listening to music, but it took a pandemic to make me learn an instrument. I chose piano for two main reasons. I liked piano for a long time, and there are many great apps to help the learning process, which was ideal at the time. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I love to learn new languages. I started with English, now I'm studying French, not at the pace I'd like because I started to develop an MVP to help the language learning process with some friends.",
