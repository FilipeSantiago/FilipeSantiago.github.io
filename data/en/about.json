    "text": "There is a quote by Benjamin Franklin that I like a lot, \"You can do anything you set your mind to\" It's an inspirational statement, but we have to keep in mind that \"set your mind to\" Is an arduous task, we need knowledge, discipline, patience, a lot of help, and a little luck to achieve our initial goal. <br /> <br /> I became a data scientist for the area challenges, and the processes to achieve results, working in data science projects. I learned to enjoy the multidomain aspect of D.S., to start a project with little knowledge of a domain, and in the middle to end be able to help specialists in that same domain to make decisions. <br /> <br /> And for my programming background, I like to understand the uses and deployment of my model, so maybe I can help other teams by doing simple tasks, such as providing REST or a Kubernetes YAML.",
